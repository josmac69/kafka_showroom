# Architecture of Apache ZooKeeper

ChatGPT:

The architecture of Apache ZooKeeper is designed to provide a highly reliable, available, and scalable coordination service for distributed systems. Its architecture consists of the following components:

1. Server Ensemble: The core of ZooKeeper's architecture is an ensemble of servers that work together to provide coordination services. The ensemble typically consists of an odd number of servers (e.g., 3, 5, 7) to avoid split-brain scenarios and maintain a quorum. A majority of servers (quorum) must be available for ZooKeeper to function properly.

2. Leader and Followers: The server ensemble is organized into a leader-follower model. At any given time, one server is designated as the leader, and the rest are followers. The leader is responsible for handling all write requests, while followers handle read requests and help maintain consistency by replicating write requests. Leaders are elected through a consensus algorithm, such as Zab (ZooKeeper Atomic Broadcast), during server startup or leader failure.

3. Znodes: ZooKeeper's data model consists of a hierarchical namespace composed of znodes (ZooKeeper nodes), which are similar to files and directories in a file system. Znodes can store data and have children, and they can be either ephemeral (automatically removed when the creating client session ends) or persistent.

4. Client-Server Interaction: Clients interact with the ZooKeeper ensemble by connecting to one of the servers. They can read data from any server, but write requests are forwarded to the leader. Clients can also set watches on znodes to receive notifications when the data or children of the znodes change.

5. Atomic Broadcast: ZooKeeper uses atomic broadcast protocols like Zab to ensure that all updates are atomic, totally ordered, and replicated consistently across the ensemble. This guarantees that every server has a consistent view of the data, even in the face of failures.

6. Snapshots and Transaction Logs: ZooKeeper stores its data in-memory, periodically persisting snapshots and transaction logs to disk. Snapshots contain the entire state of the znode hierarchy, while transaction logs record all changes made to the data since the last snapshot. In case of server failures or restarts, ZooKeeper can recover its state by replaying transaction logs on top of the latest snapshot.

7. Session Management: ZooKeeper manages client sessions, which have a unique session ID and a timeout period. If a client fails to send a heartbeat within the timeout period, its session is expired, and all ephemeral znodes created by the client are deleted. This mechanism helps maintain the consistency and liveness of the data.

8. Access Control: ZooKeeper supports access control through Access Control Lists (ACLs) associated with znodes. ACLs define the permissions (read, write, create, delete, administer) for different user-authentication schemes (e.g., IP-based, username/password, etc.).

In summary, the architecture of Apache ZooKeeper is designed to provide a highly reliable, available, and scalable coordination service for distributed systems. Its server ensemble, leader-follower model, hierarchical data model, atomic broadcast, and other architectural components work together to ensure that ZooKeeper can efficiently and consistently manage distributed systems in the face of partial failures and network partitions.
